# Java Interview Notes — Multithreading & Concurrency

> Simple-language notes for interview revision. Read top to bottom.

## 1. Thread Lifecycle (the 5 states)

*Definition:* A **thread** is a single path of execution inside a program — it's like one worker doing one sequence of tasks. A program can run many threads at once to do things in parallel. The **lifecycle** is the set of states a thread moves through from the moment it's created until it finishes.

Real life: A worker — hired (New), ready at desk (Runnable), running a task (Running), waiting for a tool someone else holds (Blocked/Waiting), goes home (Terminated).

```
New → Runnable → Running → Terminated
                   ↑  ↓
            Blocked / Waiting / Timed-Waiting
```

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **New** | Thread object created, but `start()` not called yet |
| **Runnable** | `start()` called, ready to run (waiting for CPU) |
| **Blocked** | Waiting to enter a `synchronized` lock another thread holds |
| **Waiting** | Waiting indefinitely (`wait()`, `join()`) until notified |
| **Timed-Waiting** | Waiting for a fixed time (`sleep(1000)`, `wait(500)`) |
| **Terminated** | Thread finished or stopped |

> Note: Java has no separate "Running" state in the enum — it's part of `RUNNABLE`. The OS decides when a runnable thread actually runs.

**Interview one-liner:** A thread goes New → Runnable → (Blocked/Waiting/Timed-Waiting) → Terminated. `start()` makes it Runnable; locks make it Blocked; `wait()`/`join()` make it Waiting.

---

## 2. Runnable vs Callable vs Thread

*Definition:* These are the three ways to give work to a thread. **Thread** is the worker itself (you extend it). **Runnable** and **Callable** are just *tasks* (a piece of work) that you hand to a worker to run — the difference is that Callable can give back a result and report errors, while Runnable cannot.

| | Thread | Runnable | Callable |
|--|--------|----------|----------|
| Type | Class (extend it) | Interface | Interface |
| Method | `run()` | `run()` | `call()` |
| Returns value? | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Throws checked exception? | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |

```java
// Runnable — no result
Runnable r = () -> System.out.println("working");
new Thread(r).start();

// Callable — returns a result
Callable<Integer> c = () -> 2 + 3;
Future<Integer> f = executor.submit(c);
System.out.println(f.get());   // 5
```

> Prefer **Runnable/Callable** over extending **Thread** — Java allows only one parent class, so extending Thread wastes your single inheritance.

**Interview one-liner:** Thread is the worker; Runnable is a task with no return; Callable is a task that returns a value and can throw. Prefer implementing Runnable/Callable over extending Thread.

---

## 3. ExecutorService & Thread Pools

*Definition:* An **ExecutorService** is a manager that keeps a ready-made **pool** (group) of reusable threads and runs your tasks on them. Instead of creating a brand-new thread for every task (which is slow and eats memory), you just submit tasks and the manager assigns them to free threads in the pool.

Real life: A taxi company with a fixed fleet of cars, instead of buying a new car for every customer.

```java
ExecutorService pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);
pool.submit(() -> System.out.println("task"));
pool.shutdown();   // always shut down when done
```

### Types of pools

| Pool | What it does | Best for |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Fixed** (`newFixedThreadPool(n)`) | Exactly n threads; extra tasks wait in a queue | Steady, known load |
| **Cached** (`newCachedThreadPool()`) | Creates threads as needed, reuses idle ones, kills after 60s | Many short, bursty tasks |
| **Scheduled** (`newScheduledThreadPool(n)`) | Runs tasks after a delay or on a repeat | Timers, periodic jobs |
| **Work-Stealing** (`newWorkStealingPool()`) | Idle threads "steal" tasks from busy threads' queues | Many small parallel tasks |

> Always call `shutdown()`. Otherwise the JVM may never exit (pool threads keep it alive).

**Interview one-liner:** ExecutorService reuses a pool of threads instead of creating new ones. Fixed = set size, Cached = grows/shrinks, Scheduled = delayed/repeated, Work-Stealing = idle threads steal work.

---

## 4. Future & CompletableFuture

### Future
*Definition:* A **Future** is a placeholder (an IOU) for a result that isn't ready yet. You submit a task now, get a Future back immediately, and later call `get()` to collect the actual result — but `get()` makes your thread wait (block) until the task finishes.

```java
Future<Integer> f = pool.submit(() -> 10 * 2);
Integer result = f.get();   // BLOCKS until ready → 20
```
Limitation: `get()` blocks, and you can't easily chain steps.

### CompletableFuture (the modern upgrade)
*Definition:* A **CompletableFuture** is an upgraded Future you can **chain and combine** without waiting. Instead of calling a blocking `get()`, you describe the steps up front — "do this, then transform it, then use it" — and it runs each step in the background as results become ready.

```java
CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> 5)
    .thenApply(n -> n * 2)        // transform: 5 → 10
    .thenAccept(n -> print(n));   // use result, no return
```

| Method | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| `thenApply` | Transform the result (returns a value) |
| `thenCompose` | Chain another CompletableFuture (flatten, avoids nesting) |
| `thenCombine` | Merge results of two futures |
| `allOf` | Wait for **all** futures to finish |
| `anyOf` | Finish when **any** one future completes |

> `thenApply` vs `thenCompose`: use **Apply** when your function returns a plain value, **Compose** when it returns another CompletableFuture (otherwise you get a nested `Future<Future<...>>`).

**Interview one-liner:** Future holds a result but `get()` blocks. CompletableFuture chains tasks non-blocking — `thenApply` transforms, `thenCompose` chains another future, `allOf`/`anyOf` wait for all/any.

---

## 5. `synchronized` keyword (method vs block)

*Definition:* **`synchronized`** puts a lock around a piece of code so that only **one thread at a time** can run it. Any other thread that wants in must wait its turn until the first one leaves. This stops two threads from changing shared data at the same moment and corrupting it.

Real life: A single toilet with one key — only the person holding the key gets in; others wait.

```java
// Method-level — locks the whole method
synchronized void deposit(int amt) { balance += amt; }

// Block-level — locks only the critical part (faster)
void deposit(int amt) {
    doSomeStuff();              // runs in parallel
    synchronized (this) {       // only this part is locked
        balance += amt;
    }
}
```

| | synchronized method | synchronized block |
|--|--------------------|--------------------|
| Locks | Whole method | Only chosen lines |
| Lock object | `this` (or class for static) | Any object you pick |
| Performance | Slower (bigger locked area) | Faster (smaller locked area) |

**Interview one-liner:** `synchronized` lets only one thread run the locked code. Method-level locks the whole method; block-level locks just the critical section, so it's faster.

---

## 6. `volatile` keyword (visibility)

*Definition:* **`volatile`** marks a variable as shared between threads. Normally each thread keeps a private cached copy of a variable for speed, so it can miss updates made by others. `volatile` forces every read and write to go straight to **main memory**, so all threads always see the newest value.

Real life: A shared whiteboard everyone reads from directly, instead of each person keeping a stale photocopy.

```java
volatile boolean running = true;

void stop() { running = false; }   // other threads see it immediately
void run()  { while (running) {} } // without volatile, may loop forever
```

> `volatile` gives **visibility** but NOT **atomicity**. `count++` is still unsafe with volatile (it's read-modify-write = 3 steps). For counters use `AtomicInteger` or `synchronized`.

**Interview one-liner:** `volatile` guarantees every thread sees the latest value (visibility) by skipping the CPU cache — but it does NOT make compound actions like `count++` atomic.

---

## 7. ReentrantLock vs synchronized

*Definition:* A **ReentrantLock** is a flexible, manual version of `synchronized`. Instead of Java locking and unlocking automatically, *you* call `lock()` to grab it and `unlock()` to release it. This extra control unlocks features `synchronized` can't do (like trying for a lock with a timeout) — but you must remember to unlock, or other threads stay stuck forever.

```java
ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
lock.lock();
try {
    balance += amt;     // critical section
} finally {
    lock.unlock();      // MUST unlock in finally
}
```

| Feature | synchronized | ReentrantLock |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| Lock/unlock | Automatic | Manual (`lock`/`unlock`) |
| Try without blocking | ❌ | ✅ `tryLock()` |
| Timeout | ❌ | ✅ `tryLock(2, SECONDS)` |
| Fairness (FIFO order) | ❌ | ✅ optional |
| Interruptible wait | ❌ | ✅ |

> "Reentrant" = a thread already holding the lock can acquire it again without deadlocking itself. Both `synchronized` and `ReentrantLock` are reentrant.

**Easy rule of thumb:** Use `synchronized` for simple cases. Use `ReentrantLock` when you need `tryLock`, a timeout, fairness, or interruptible locking.

**Interview one-liner:** synchronized is automatic and simple; ReentrantLock is manual but adds tryLock, timeouts, fairness, and interruptibility — just remember to unlock in a `finally`.

---

## 8. Deadlock, Livelock, Starvation

*Definition:* These are three common threading problems where threads stop getting useful work done. **Deadlock** = everyone frozen waiting on each other; **Livelock** = everyone busy but going nowhere; **Starvation** = one unlucky thread never gets its turn.

| Problem | What happens | Real life |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| **Deadlock** | Two threads each hold a lock the other needs — both wait forever | Two people each grab one chopstick, both wait for the other |
| **Livelock** | Threads keep reacting to each other and changing state, but no work gets done | Two people in a hallway both step the same way repeatedly |
| **Starvation** | A thread never gets CPU/lock because others keep grabbing it first | A polite person never gets through a pushy crowd |

### Deadlock example
```java
synchronized (lockA) {
    synchronized (lockB) { ... }   // Thread 1: A then B
}
// Thread 2 does: B then A  →  DEADLOCK
```

### Prevention
- **Lock ordering** → always acquire locks in the same global order (A then B everywhere).
- **tryLock with timeout** → give up if you can't get the lock in time.
- **Avoid nested locks** when possible.
- **Fair locks** → fight starvation with `new ReentrantLock(true)`.

**Interview one-liner:** Deadlock = both stuck waiting on each other's lock; Livelock = both active but no progress; Starvation = one thread never gets a turn. Prevent deadlock with consistent lock ordering and tryLock timeouts.

---

## 9. Race Conditions

*Definition:* A **race condition** is a bug where the final result depends on the **unpredictable timing** of threads — they "race" each other. When two threads read and update the same shared data at almost the same moment, one thread's change can overwrite the other's, so updates get silently lost.

```java
int count = 0;
void inc() { count++; }   // read, +1, write = 3 steps

// Two threads run inc() 1000 times each.
// Expected 2000, but you often get less — updates get lost.
```
Why: `count++` isn't atomic. Thread A reads 5, Thread B reads 5, both write 6 → one increment lost.

### How to avoid
- `synchronized` or `ReentrantLock` around the shared update.
- **Atomic** classes (`AtomicInteger`) for counters.
- **Immutable** objects (can't be corrupted if they never change).
- Avoid sharing — use `ThreadLocal` or local variables.

**Interview one-liner:** A race condition is when threads access shared data at the same time and the outcome depends on timing. Fix it with synchronization, atomic variables, or immutability.

---

## 10. Semaphore, CountDownLatch, CyclicBarrier, Phaser

*Definition:* These are **coordination tools** (from `java.util.concurrent`) that control how threads wait for each other — for example, limiting how many run at once, or making threads pause until a group is ready before continuing.

| Tool | What it does | Real life |
|------|--------------|-----------|
| **Semaphore** | Allows only N threads at once (permits) | Parking lot with N spots |
| **CountDownLatch** | One/many threads wait until a counter hits 0 (one-time) | Wait for 3 services to boot, then start |
| **CyclicBarrier** | All threads wait at a point, then all proceed together (reusable) | Race: everyone waits at the line, then GO |
| **Phaser** | Like a flexible, multi-phase CyclicBarrier (threads can join/leave) | Multi-round game with changing players |

```java
// Semaphore — max 2 threads in the section
Semaphore sem = new Semaphore(2);
sem.acquire();  try { useResource(); } finally { sem.release(); }

// CountDownLatch — wait for 3 tasks to finish
CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(3);
// each task: latch.countDown();
latch.await();   // blocks until count = 0
```

> Key difference: **CountDownLatch** is one-shot (can't reuse). **CyclicBarrier** resets and can be reused for repeated rounds.

**Interview one-liner:** Semaphore limits concurrent access (N permits); CountDownLatch waits for a count to reach zero (one-time); CyclicBarrier makes threads wait for each other then proceed together (reusable); Phaser is a flexible multi-phase barrier.

---

## 11. ThreadLocal

*Definition:* A **ThreadLocal** gives each thread its **own private copy** of a variable. Even though the code looks like one shared variable, every thread silently gets a separate value — so threads never see or overwrite each other's data, removing the need for locks.

Real life: Everyone gets their own personal notebook; no one writes in yours.

```java
ThreadLocal<Integer> userId = ThreadLocal.withInitial(() -> 0);

userId.set(42);          // only this thread sees 42
int id = userId.get();   // 42 here; a different thread sees its own value
userId.remove();         // clean up to avoid memory leaks
```

> Common use: storing per-request data (user ID, DB connection, `SimpleDateFormat`) in web servers, where each request runs on its own thread.
>
> **Gotcha:** in thread pools, threads are reused — always `remove()` after use or old values leak into the next task.

**Interview one-liner:** ThreadLocal gives each thread its own isolated copy of a variable — great for per-thread data like user context. Always `remove()` in thread pools to avoid leaks.

---

## 12. Atomic classes (CAS)

*Definition:* **Atomic** classes (like `AtomicInteger`) let many threads update one value safely **without locks**. They rely on a fast CPU instruction called **CAS (Compare-And-Swap)** that does the check-and-update in one un-interruptible step, so no two threads can clash.

### What is CAS?
*Definition:* **CAS** stands for **Compare-And-Swap**. The rule is: "if the value is still what I expect, swap it to my new value; if someone already changed it, fail and let me try again." Because it's one un-interruptible CPU instruction, no other thread can sneak in halfway.

```
CAS(memory, expected, new):
   if memory == expected → set memory = new, return true
   else → return false (someone changed it, try again)
```

```java
AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);
count.incrementAndGet();   // safe ++ with no lock
count.compareAndSet(5, 6); // set to 6 only if currently 5

AtomicReference<String> ref = new AtomicReference<>("a");
ref.compareAndSet("a", "b");
```

| | synchronized | Atomic (CAS) |
|--|--------------|--------------|
| Uses locks? | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (lock-free) |
| Speed | Slower (threads wait) | Faster (retry loop) |
| Best for | Complex critical sections | Single counters/references |

> CAS is the engine behind `ConcurrentHashMap`, `AtomicInteger`, and most lock-free code. Downside: under heavy contention, lots of retries.

**Interview one-liner:** Atomic classes update values lock-free using CAS (compare-and-swap): change the value only if it still equals the expected one, else retry. Faster than locks for simple counters.

---

## 13. Fork/Join Framework

*Definition:* The **Fork/Join framework** is built for "divide-and-conquer" work. It splits a big task into smaller subtasks (**fork**), runs those subtasks in parallel across CPU cores, and then combines their results back into one answer (**join**).

Real life: To count a huge pile of votes, split it among many people, then add up their counts.

```java
class SumTask extends RecursiveTask<Long> {
    protected Long compute() {
        if (small enough) return computeDirectly();
        SumTask left = ...; SumTask right = ...;
        left.fork();                 // run left in parallel
        return right.compute() + left.join();  // combine
    }
}
new ForkJoinPool().invoke(new SumTask(...));
```

> Uses **work-stealing**: an idle thread steals subtasks from a busy thread's queue, keeping all cores busy. This is what powers parallel streams (`list.parallelStream()`).

**Interview one-liner:** Fork/Join splits a big task into subtasks (fork), runs them in parallel, and merges results (join). It uses work-stealing to keep all CPU cores busy — and powers parallel streams.

---

## 14. Virtual Threads (Java 21 — Project Loom)

*Definition:* **Virtual threads** are super-lightweight threads managed by the JVM itself instead of the operating system. Normal "platform" threads are heavy (each ties up real OS resources), so you can only have a few thousand. Virtual threads are so cheap you can run **millions** at once, making them ideal for handling huge numbers of waiting tasks.

Real life: Old threads = hiring full-time staff (expensive, limited). Virtual threads = tickets in a queue the JVM juggles over a few real workers.

```java
// Old way — limited (~few thousand max)
Thread.ofPlatform().start(task);

// Virtual thread — can have millions
Thread.ofVirtual().start(task);

// Best with executor
try (var ex = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()) {
    ex.submit(task);
}
```

| | Platform thread | Virtual thread |
|--|-----------------|----------------|
| Managed by | OS | JVM |
| Cost | Heavy (~1MB stack) | Very light (~few KB) |
| How many | Thousands | Millions |
| Best for | CPU-heavy work | Blocking I/O (DB, HTTP calls) |

> When a virtual thread blocks (e.g. waiting on I/O), the JVM "parks" it and reuses the real carrier thread for other work — so blocking becomes cheap. No need for pools or async callbacks.

**Interview one-liner:** Virtual threads (Java 21) are JVM-managed lightweight threads — you can run millions cheaply. The JVM parks them on blocking I/O and reuses real threads, making blocking code scale like async.

---

## Quick Revision Cheat Sheet

- **Lifecycle**: New → Runnable → (Blocked/Waiting/Timed-Waiting) → Terminated.
- **Runnable** = no return; **Callable** = returns value + throws; prefer over extending **Thread**.
- **ExecutorService** reuses a pool: Fixed, Cached, Scheduled, Work-Stealing. Always `shutdown()`.
- **Future** blocks on `get()`; **CompletableFuture** chains: thenApply, thenCompose, allOf, anyOf.
- **synchronized**: one thread at a time; block-level is faster than method-level.
- **volatile**: visibility only, NOT atomicity (`count++` still unsafe).
- **ReentrantLock** > synchronized when you need tryLock, timeout, fairness; unlock in `finally`.
- **Deadlock** (mutual wait), **Livelock** (active no progress), **Starvation** (never gets turn). Fix deadlock with lock ordering.
- **Race condition** = timing-dependent corruption; fix with sync, atomics, or immutability.
- **Semaphore** (N permits), **CountDownLatch** (one-time count to 0), **CyclicBarrier** (reusable meet-point), **Phaser** (multi-phase).
- **ThreadLocal** = per-thread copy; `remove()` in pools.
- **Atomic** = lock-free via **CAS** (compare-and-swap, retry if changed).
- **Fork/Join** = split→parallel→merge with work-stealing; powers parallel streams.
- **Virtual threads** (Java 21) = millions of cheap JVM threads; best for blocking I/O.
